## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, creamy white (#F8F5EC) to evoke the purity and freshness of milk.
- Background color: Light, desaturated beige (#E8E4DE), a subtle variation of the primary to maintain a consistent, calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted sky blue (#97BBD9), analogous to the primary, to provide a gentle contrast and highlight key interactive elements.
- Body text: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that offers a blend of modern clarity with slight warmth, suitable for readable content blocks.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif, for elegant titles and prominent messaging. Use 'PT Sans' for the body if longer text is anticipated.
- Use clean, minimalist icons that represent dairy products, delivery, and user account functions. Icons should use the accent color for a subtle highlight.
- Maintain a clean, grid-based layout with generous spacing to ensure readability and a sense of openness. Prioritize clear information hierarchy and easy navigation.
